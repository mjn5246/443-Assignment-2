# 443-Assignment-2

The file "test.go" tries to generate a password with a given pattern. 
However, I still can not select a random word from the given dictionary. 

Update on Assignment2:
I checked the code and to my knowledge it seems like it works

Update on Assignment 3:
Got create to work. Check for any bugs
Also for my path variable you will have to change it to where you have
the file.
